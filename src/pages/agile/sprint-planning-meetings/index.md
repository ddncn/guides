## Sprint Planning Meetings

A meeting before or at the beginning of a sprint when your team plans what work will get done in the sprint. You'll pick as much work from the product backlog as you think you can do in one sprint. This work goes into the sprint backlog. During the sprint, you pull a work item out of the backlog, work it to completion, then repeat.
